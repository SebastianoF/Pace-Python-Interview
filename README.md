# Python Take Home Test

First of all, thank you for taking the time to complete this test in advance. 

Before we begin, I just wanted to say that we understand that not all people do well in live coding interviews
for a variety of reasons and sometimes these are out of everyone's control. The good news is that everyone at Pace really enjoyed talking to you about your background and development experience
so far.

We want this test to be as realistic as possible meaning:
- Feel free to Google / Stack Overflow anything you need help with.
- Feel free to contact us if you really are stuck and don't understand the questions.
- Spend as long as you need but we expect in reality it should not take more than 2 hours to fully complete. 
- There is creative freedom on how you approach the questions and how you layout your answers. We are mainly looking for clean, readable code which achieves the objective of the questions. 

## Notes before we begin
- We strongly advice the use of comments throughout your code as it gives us a good indication to what you are trying to achieve and your current though process.
- This code does not have to run. This means that we are looking for overall development and well thought
    out answers that are clean and show off that you can solidly break down problems and solve them. 
- There are currently no tests for these tasks and we do NOT expect you to write tests of any sort.
- Take your time to digest what is being asked and make sure to fully read questions (there's normally hints at
    the end in case you're really stuck)
- **We kindly ask that you do not contact other candidates who may have taken this test in regards to questions or previous answers. 
We change the tests enough each time that previous answers will not be correct anymore and will give very obvious indications that a candidate has cheated.**
  
##Â Outline of the repository:
- `app.py` The main code for the test
- `/questions` The question mark down files
- `models.py` The main database models
- `utils.py` The utility file which allows getting a session to a *fake* database. Please don't worry about this file.

## The Test
To begin the test:
- Clone the repo locally
- Checkout a new branch called `interview/your-full-name`
- Navigate to the questions folder and start on Question 1.
- We expect you to attempt/finish both questions located in the questions folder. 

To end the test:
- Create a Pull Request with your changes and then notify us by email that you have finished.
